COMP90054 assignment 2, semester 2, 2021: PDDL modelling

share_secret_domain.pddl contains a skeleton for the domain file for tasks 1 and 5.

share_secret_task[X]_problem.pddl contains skeleton for the problem files.

Only these file PDDL files will be marked for the assignment. Any other files created will be ignored, so you are free to create new models to experiment.

The main branch will be cloned on the due date for marking.
